##### museModel.py
Code for the LSTM and Dense neural network architecture created using Keras during the hackathon. This code is able to reach a validation accuracy that is consistently above baseline, and performed the best out of all the architectures I tried.  
##### museDense.py 
Neural network architecture comprised purely of Dense layers. This is the simplest type of neural network architecture, and was not complex enough to accurately classify data from the Muse Headband.  

This code also processes the CSV data file and converts the data into Numpy arrays for use by the neural network model.
